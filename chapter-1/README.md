# Object-Oriented Design

## In Praise of Design

I like how Sandi starts the book by starting trying to answer the question, "why design matter?". Far from philosophical reasons, I find myself learn things better when I understand the reason why those particular things are needed at all.

So, why do we need object-oriented design? This will not immediately answer the question, but please bear with me. 

Any software we write will change. In Sandi's words, "change is unavoidable. It is ubiquitous, omnipresent, and inevitable."

I can totally relate to that. In my years working on consultancy projects, I found myself frustrated by how many times things changed in my projects. Reading this chapter, now I understand my past frustration better.

It was not because of the ever increasing scope of the project. That too was frustrating. But latter in my consultancy career somehow our team managed to secure contracts on time basis which meant that we kept getting paid as long as the project was running. Therefore, more scope equals more money.

But we still loathed ever changing projects. The reason being, without proper design, our source codes were expensive to change. In [Sandi's talk at GoRuCo 2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2yFMzxqwU), she described this phenomenon very well:

1. Rigid

    Every change causes a cascade of related changes.

2. Fragile

    Distant and apparently unrelated code breaks after every change.  

3. Immobile

    Code is hopelessly entangled so you can't reuse anything.

4. Viscous

    Behaving badly is the nost attractive alternative.
